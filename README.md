In this code example, we have implemented three structural design patterns:

Adapter Pattern: We have used the Adapter pattern to adapt the LegacyRectangle interface to the Rectangle interface using the RectangleAdapter class. This allows us to use the legacy rectangle implementation with the updated rectangle interface.

Decorator Pattern: We have used the Decorator pattern to add additional behavior to the Shape interface using the ShapeDecorator and RedShapeDecorator classes. This allows us to dynamically add new behavior to shapes at runtime without modifying their implementation.

Facade Pattern: We have used the Facade pattern to create a simplified interface for a complex system of subsystems (i.e., Engine, FuelInjector, and Ignition) using the CarFacade class. This allows clients to interact with the system in a simplified manner, hiding the complexity of the subsystems.
